# SmartUtility (Client Side)


---

## 📖 Overview  
SmartUtility is a web-based client application that provides users with a clean, responsive interface to manage and interact with various utility-related tools. The client side is built for ease of use — allowing users to perform tasks such as tracking utilities, viewing reports or data, and managing configurations — all from a user-friendly dashboard.

This project is part of a larger SmartUtility ecosystem, where the client communicates with a backend service to fetch data and perform operations.
